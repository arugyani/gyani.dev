# Aru Gyani

I am a full-stack developer at [NCR Voyix](https://ncrvoyix.com). I like making things that live on screens. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the web, compilers & automata theory, and physics simulators.

Since childhood, I've explored web development, game programming, and machine learning. In recent years, I've interned in both machine learning and full-stack roles, co-founded a startup, and completed my BSc in Computer Science at UT Dallas.

I enjoy keeping a public record of my [notes](/notes), [projects](/projects), and ongoing interests. I write about what I'm working on [here](/projects/gyani-dev), and you can also find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/arugyani) and [LinkedIn](https://linkedin.com/in/arugyani)**.**
