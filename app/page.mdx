# Aru Gyani

I am a full-stack developer at [NCR Voyix](https://ncrvoyix.com). I like making things that live on screens. Lately, I've been thinking a lot about the web, compilers & automata theory, and physics simulators.

Since childhood, I've explored web development, game programming, and machine learning. In recent years, I've interned in both machine learning and full-stack roles, co-founded a startup, and completed my BSc in Computer Science at UT Dallas.

I enjoy keeping a public record of my notes, projects, and ongoing interests. I write about what I'm working on here, and you can also find me on GitHub and LinkedIn.

> This site is deeply inspired by [shud.in](https://shud.in), Shu Ding's brilliant personal site. This actually began as a learning exercise. I believe in studying what makes great work great by building something of my own in the same spirit. While I've written the code myself and shaped it to fit my needs, much of the structure and feel are rooted in his design.
