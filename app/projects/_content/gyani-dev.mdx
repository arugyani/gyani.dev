# Building [gyani.dev](https://gyani.dev)

Over the years, this site has gone through more iterations than I can keep track of. 
- In 2021, I was learning [React](https://react.dev) and built a version using *Create React App* and raw CSS styling: [gh/arugyani/portfolio](https://github.com/arugyani/portfolio)
- In 2022, my interest in what we can do with CSS grew, and I replaced React with a barebones HTML/CSS site: [gh/arugyani/web-portfolio](https://github.com/arugyani/web-portfolio)
- In 2023, I built a more ambitious portfolio with loading animations, color transitions, and more (built on React): [gh/arugyani/React-Portfolio](https://github.com/arugyani/React-Portfolio)

Earlier this year, I became obsessed with performance optimization. I built a fast-loading proof-of-concept portfolio/blog hybrid using [Astro](https://astro.build). Astro was a joy to use, and seeing pages load almost instantly was immensely satisfying.

Now, in July 2025, I'm reevaluating how I want to represent myself online. You'll notice that this site is **heavily inspired** by Shu Ding's brilliant personal site ([shud.in](https://shud.in)). 

I don't take credit for this design, in fact, this write-up exists primarily to acknowledge that. After discovering Shu's site and diving into his other work, I was fascinated. I explored his GitHub, studied his work, and decided to treat rebuilding this site as a kind of copywriting and reverse-engineering exercise. 

> For anyone interested, the idea behind cloning this site is pretty succinctly explained in [this essay](https://www.shaanpuri.com/essays/shamelessly-cloning) by Shaan Puri. 

> So far, I've made only a few tweaks. There's now a dark mode (based on your system's color settings), different fonts, and some minor styling changes. **More to come!**

As I shift focus from development to design, I'll be experimenting with new, original concepts in the coming months. In the meantime, I highly encourage you to check out [shud.in](https://shud.in) and the corresponding source.
