# Algorithm Visualizer

After graduating college in 2024, I was a bit bored over the summer as I waited to start my job. Once my boredom hit its peak in July, I decided to build a tiny algorithm visualizer. This is a fairly classic project and I'd never built one until this point, so my thought process was that there's no better time than the present. Let's dive in!

## Goals
There were a couple things I wanted to achieve with this project:
1. Try out some graphics programming in C++
2. Gain a more intuitive understanding of how Dijkstra's Algorithm works
3. Stop being bored

## Tech Stack
I wanted this project to be as lightweight as I could reasonably get it, so I kept things quite simple.
- [C++](https://cplusplus.com/) — For the uninitiated, C++ is one of the most famously used programming languages in the world.
- [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) — SFML is a C++. multi-media rendering library. In other words, SFML is to C++ what Lego bricks are to plastic.

## Structure
The structure of this project is fairly straight forward. I tried to keep logic relatively de-coupled between interactive UI components & the visualizer itself. Thus,

```txt
Core/
    Algorithm.cpp
    Canvas.cpp
    Grid.cpp
    Node.cpp
    Window.cpp
UI/
    Button.cpp
    Text.cpp
main.cpp
```

With that out of the way, let's take a look at how things work.

### Entry point
Following the nearly ubiquitous C++ pattern, `main.cpp` is the primary entry point to the application. Here, the following actions occur (in order):
1. A window object is instantiated from `Core::Window`
2. Two shared pointers are created referencing `Core::Canvas` and `Core::Grid`, respectively.
3. The grid is initialized and added to the canvas.
4. UI components are created under their own shared pointers.
5. The canvas & all UI components are added to the window
6. The window is started!
