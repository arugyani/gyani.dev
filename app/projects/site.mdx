day 1:
- next create app - something about the code structure looks aesthetically better without src holding everything idk what it is.
- configuring mdx-components, need to add experimental flag in next.config.ts
- Shu Ding's method of handling mdx components is pretty robust and lets you have custom styling for every single one.
- storing fonts in _fonts and extra content in _content? not sure i understand the purpose yet
    - picked out my own fonts, Open Sans, Noto Serif, and Inconsolata
- how does mdx work?
- color palettes are great. where did he learn or pickup his principles of design?
