# Lessons & exploration in Minesweeper

Since 2022, I've developed a mild addiction to playing Minesweeper in my free time. I believe that we can learn a lot from Minesweeper. From the principle(s) of mastery to avoiding perfectionism, there's a lot of perspective to be gained here, even from something (and antiquated) as Minesweeper.

## [The Pareto Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle)
In Minesweeper, pattern recognition is everything. Players across all levels build up their pattern recognition to get better at chording. 

> **Chording**: "When a number has the correct amount of flags, you can click on the number to open all the cells around it ... [this] greatly reduces unnecessary clicks, and is the foundation of efficient gameplay" - [Minesweeper Online](https://minesweeper.online/help/gameplay)

As players get better at recognizing patterns in Minesweeper, they reduce the amount of thinking required to clear the board of mines. Consequently, this generally is manifested by an increase in the speed players are able to flag & clear cells.

This is quite intuitive. Learning patterns in a game make you better at that game. Shocker. But, why is this section titled "The Pareto Principle"?

I'm glad I asked. Based on Wikipedia, the general idea of the Pareto principle is that for many different things, "roughly 80% of consequences from from 20% of causes" [[1]](#references). Personally, I first heard about this concept from a teacher speaking about building mastery in a subject. 

They explained that to master something, 80% of the initial learning and work you'll do is the easy part. The hard part, is getting through the final 20% where you start to form deeper connections and building true expertise. Although this is a bit different than the original principle, the basic concept still remains. Now, why does this relate to Minesweeper? 

I want to take the basic hypothesis below and see if we can find the Pareto principle in play.

### Hypothesis
Getting good at Minesweeper is easy. Mastering it is hard. (shocker!)

- To get pretty good at Minesweeper, you can get there with 80% of upfront work: simple pattern recognition.
- To achieve mastery, you'll need the 20% of remaining work: becoming an efficient decision maker
    - Thinking ahead is valuable in moderation. Recognizing patterns in advance can massively improve your efficiency, but it would be a waste of time to try thinking 10 moves ahead. This game is inherently unpredictable. Decisive players who can choose between multiple patterns at once will be more successful than those who simply pick the first pattern they see.

To quantify skill in Minesweeper, we'll base it on the speed at which a player is able to complete an Expert level game on [Minesweeper Online](https://minesweeper.online).

## Life lessons
It might be nice to find some legitimate value in this experiment of Minesweeper.

- We can't plan for everything. Just as Minesweeper is inherently unpredictable, so is life. All we can do is get better at pattern recognition & decision making. (A lot of other skills are important  too but I think these 2 are pretty useful!)
- Take a look at the Minesweeper leaderboards and watch some replays. No matter how hard you work or strive towards something there will **always** be someone or something more advanced. That's a good thing. *Imagine how boring life would be if you were always the best at everything.*
    - Chase excellence, not perfection. Shoot for the stars, land on the moon. It all points to the same idea at the end of the day.

I never really planned on finding life lessons by playing Minesweeper, nor did I plan on getting obsessed with this game in the first place. However, I'd like to think I've gained something from my time spent playing it, even if that's just a *deeply ingrained desire to right click squares*.
