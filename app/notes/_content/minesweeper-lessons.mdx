Since 2023, I've been developing a mild addiction to playing Minesweeper in my free time.  After spending 2 years playing the game and improving a bit, I've realized that we might be able to see some classic life lessons in action here.

## The Pareto principle
In Minesweeper, patterns shape everything. Players across all levels build up their pattern recognition as they improve and use these to chain clearances around the board to optimize their efficiency. 

Roughly speaking, a good Minesweeper run breaks down to about 80% pattern recognition, 19% quick decision-making (lots of patterns & so many choices), and 1% probability (sometimes you just have to guess).

At a high level, a big takeaway here is that you can get pretty good at Minesweeper through memorizing just a few key patterns. Improving your decision making on the other hand, takes repetition, analysis, and a lot of time. 

The same can be generally applied to building skills in the real world. Typically, 80% of the skill comes from simply learning the existing material or concepts. The difficulty of achieving mastery lies in the remaining 20% where one has to think critically, push the edges of what they're exploring, and sometimes take some risks. Formally, this phenomena 

Getting good at minesweeper is easy. Mastering it is hard.

- Thinking ahead is valuable in moderation. In minesweeper, you can massively improve your efficiency by thinking ahead and recognizing patterns as they come a few steps in advance. But it would be a waste of time to try thinking 10 moves ahead, not all the mines are revealed and we can't ever TRULY know what is to come. The same sentiment applies to daily life. Thinking ahead and optimizing your actions as they correspond to your goals can help, but overdoing it might just set you back. You never know what life has in store and we can't plan for everything.

- There will **always** be someone or something for you to strive towards. Perfection is impossible, but excellence is not. This is something I'm working on myself. Even the number 1 minesweeper player in the world is going to make a mistake or be challenged by a newcomer. The same goes for life where there are people in all fields with skills beyond our wildest imaginations, and yet they too have limits. So all we can do is keep working on improving without the expectation of perfection. 

I never really planned on finding life lessons by playing Minesweeper, nor did I plan on getting obsessed with the game in the first place. However, I'd like to think I've gained something from my time spent playing it, even if that's just an ingrained desire to right click squares.
